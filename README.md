Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction
Objective:
In this project, the objective is to predict Car Price based on various features like Car's Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Owner, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission. We will use the CAR DEKHO dataset. This dataset contains information about used cars listed on cardekho website.
Project Scope:
We have historical data on used car prices from CarDekho, including various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and other relevant attributes from different cities. Our task as a data scientist is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of used cars based on these features. The model should be integrated into a Streamlit-based web application to allow users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.

Tools Python, Pandas(Library), numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, joblib, xgboost
Approach 
Python: The core programming language used for scripting and data processing.
Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library.
Numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Sklearn: A free and open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language
Seaborn: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
matplotlib.pyplot : A state-based interface to matplotlib. It provides an implicit, MATLAB-like, way of plotting. It also opens figures on your screen, and acts as the figure GUI manager.
joblib: A Python library for running computationally intensive tasks in parallel.
xgboost: An open-source software library that implements machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, ranking, and user-defined prediction challenges
Findings--> Detailed analysis was given how the price of the car is determined, the different features to consider when buying or selling a used car.
